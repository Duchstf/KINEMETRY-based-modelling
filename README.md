# KINEMETRY-based-modelling

The program uses KINEMETRY package to model different dynamical parameters of galaxies. 


## Introduction


KINEMETRY Package was written in IDL by Davor KrajnoviÄ‡. It is primarily a program to carry out "analysis of 2D maps of (kinematic) moments of the line-of-sight-velocity distribution (LOSVD)," ans is described in details [here](http://davor.krajnovic.org/idl/#kinemetry).

For the purposes of my research, I just ultilize it in order to fit rotation curves and model the velocity fields, which will be displayed using the Python codes that I wrote.

This document is intended for people who want to use my code to get the properly displayed graphs or people who want to develop on this project
