# KINEMETRY-based-modelling

The program uses KINEMETRY package to model different dynamical parameters of galaxies. 


## Introduction

KINEMETRY Package was written in IDL by Davor KrajnoviÄ‡. It is primarily a program to carry out "analysis of 2D maps of (kinematic) moments of the line-of-sight-velocity distribution (LOSVD)," and is described in details [here](http://davor.krajnovic.org/idl/#kinemetry).

For the purposes of my research, I ultilized it in order to fit rotation curves and model the velocity fields, which will be displayed using the Python codes that I wrote.

This document is intended for people who want to use my codes to get the properly displayed graphs or people (the very beginners) who want to develop on this project. 

**NOTE:** At this point I don't know how to use Shell to develop a User Interface. Thus, the following instructions will guide you through each manual step to produce the figures without a User Interface. 

## Instructions for absolute beginners
###### I Assumed that the folders in this resporitory has already been downloaded to your computer.
1) Open IDL (since IDL might have multiple versions on the computers, the easiest way to open directly the newest version is to type "idlde" to XQuartz)

2)
